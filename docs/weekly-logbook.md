## Lab 1: Lab Setup and IT Venture Repository

### What We Completed
1. Set up the GitHub repository with the required folder structure including docs, prototype, data, finance, diagrams, screenshots, and pitch folders.
2. Created and filled in all required documents including README.md, team-profile.md, idea-log.md, and problem-notes.md.
3. Identified three possible IT venture ideas and documented each one using the problem, target users, current alternative, proposed solution, technology, and suitability format.

### What We Learned
1. How to set up and manage a GitHub repository including creating folders, writing commit messages, and organizing project files.
2. How to think about a problem from a user perspective and turn it into a possible IT solution.

### Problems or Difficulties
1. It was our first time using GitHub so setting up the repository structure and making commits took some time to figure out.
2. Choosing three distinct and realistic ideas was challenging as we wanted each idea to be genuinely useful for students.

### Evidence of Work
- GitHub repository link: https://github.com/HTETHTET-68/ICT105-TeamTriByte-MVP
- Files created:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/team-profile.md`
  - `docs/idea-log.md`
  - `docs/problem-notes.md`
  - `docs/weekly-logbook.md`

### Decision Made This Week
No final decision was made yet. The team logged three initial venture ideas, HallPass, CampusMarket, and StudyMatch, each with a defined problem area, target users, current alternatives, and a possible IT solution. These ideas were documented for further evaluation rather than committed to at this stage.

### Plan for Next Week
In Lab 2, the team will expand the idea pool, score all opportunities using the NUF (New, Useful, Feasible) framework, and select the strongest idea to move forward with as our semester project.

## Lab 02: IT Opportunity Scanning

### What We Completed

1. Reviewed six potential IT venture opportunities and analyzed their target users, problems, and current alternatives.
2. Created a NUF (New, Useful, Feasible) scoring matrix to evaluate and compare all opportunities.
3. Selected HallPass as the semester project and documented the opportunity in the repository.

### Selected Opportunity

**HallPass – Student Reviews & Campus Survival Guide**

### Why We Selected It

HallPass received the highest NUF score among the opportunities reviewed.

* **New:** Provides student-generated reviews and survival guides that are not commonly available through official university channels.
* **Useful:** Helps international and first-year students make informed decisions about housing, food, and campus life.
* **Feasible:** Can be prototyped using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and sample data without requiring IoT devices or advanced cybersecurity implementation.

The project addresses a real student problem while remaining achievable within the semester timeline.

### What We Rejected

**CampusMarket – Student Marketplace**

This idea was rejected because it would require more complex features such as transaction management, user verification, and trust mechanisms. Compared to HallPass, it was less feasible to develop as a semester MVP and would be more difficult to validate during the early stages of the project.

### What We Learned

1. A good startup idea must solve a real problem experienced by a specific target user.
2. NUF scoring helps teams make objective decisions when comparing multiple opportunities.
3. Feasibility is as important as usefulness when selecting a semester-long project.

### Plan for Lab 03

The team will conduct customer problem discovery by interviewing and surveying international students, first-year students, and exchange students.

We will:

* Prepare customer discovery questions.
* Identify target respondents.
* Conduct interviews and surveys.
* Collect evidence about current challenges related to dormitories, cafeterias, and campus life.
* Validate whether students would use a platform such as HallPass.

The key question we want to answer is:

> Do international and first-year students experience enough difficulty finding reliable information about dormitories, cafeterias, and campus life to justify using a dedicated platform like HallPass?
# Weekly Venture Logbook

## Lab 03: Customer Problem Discovery

### What We Completed
1. Designed a 10-question customer discovery survey and distributed it to international, exchange, and first-year students via Google Forms.
2. Collected 20 survey responses and recorded them in a structured raw response file covering workarounds, time spent, difficulty rating, main pain, and willingness to use HallPass.
3. Built an assumption-evidence table comparing 8 team assumptions against real survey data and determined which to keep, revise, or reject.

### What We Learned About the Problem
1. The problem is real and confirmed — international, exchange, and first-year students consistently rated difficulty finding campus information as 4 or 5 out of 5, and 13 out of 20 spent more than 30 minutes searching.
2. Students trust peer experiences more than official university websites, which means a student-written review platform is more valuable than a university information page.
3. The first-week guide is equally as important as dorm and cafeteria reviews — we originally treated it as a secondary feature but the evidence shows it should be a core feature.

### What Evidence We Collected
- Number of respondents: 20 survey responses
- Evidence file: `data/raw-responses.xlsx`
- Key repeated pattern: Students rely on friends, LINE group chats, and social media because there is no single trusted place for campus information — leading to scattered searches, wasted time, and stress

### What We Changed Based on Evidence
- Elevated the first-week guide to a core feature alongside dorm and cafeteria reviews, not a secondary one
- Updated the target user group to include exchange students explicitly, not just international and first-year students
- Revised the problem statement to reflect that consequences include both stress and wasted time, not stress alone
- Updated the updated problem statement in README.md to reflect all changes from Lab 03 findings

### Problems or Difficulties
1. Some survey responses were from second or third-year students who had already adapted to campus life, which made their answers less useful for validating our core problem.
2. The survey did not ask whether students would write reviews or only read them, which left a gap in understanding how content would be contributed to HallPass.

### Evidence of Work

- Commit link: (https://github.com/HTETHTET-68/ICT105-TriByte-MVP/commits/main/) 

### Plan for Lab 04
In Lab 04, the team will use the validated evidence from Lab 03 to define a clear customer segment and build a user persona representing our primary target user. We will identify the persona's goals, frustrations, and behaviors based on the survey patterns. We will then write user stories in the format "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" to describe what HallPass must do from the user's perspective. These outputs will guide the feature prioritization and prototype planning in the following labs.

## **2. Main Decisions**

- **Primary target user:** First-year, international, and exchange students who are navigating dorm, cafeteria, and campus-life decisions for the first time.

- **Main persona:** **"May"** — a first-year university student in her first 1–3 months on campus, currently relying on friends, social media, group chats, and the university website (all scattered/unreliable) to find dorm and food information.

- **Most important problem:** Students spend excessive time (often 30–60+ minutes per search) hunting for trustworthy, up-to-date campus information because it is scattered across multiple informal sources and not written by real students.

- **Must-have requirements:**
  - Landing page explaining HallPass's purpose (FR-01)
  - Clear navigation path from homepage → search → reviews → submit (FR-02)
  - Review submission with ratings/comments (FR-03)
  - Persistent storage of reviews (FR-04)
  - Browsable review listings (FR-05)
  - Search/filter by keyword or category (FR-06)
  - Full review detail pages (FR-07)

- **Features included in MVP:**
  - Search Dormitories (F01)
  - Browse Cafeteria Reviews (F02)
  - View Detailed Reviews (F03)
  - Submit Reviews (F04)
  - Search & Filter Reviews (F05)

  **Should Have**
  - Campus Survival Guide (F06)
  - Admin Review Moderation (F07)
  - 1–5 Star Rating System (F08)

- **Features postponed:**
  - Favorite/Save Reviews (F09)
  - Interactive Campus Map (F10)
  - AI Recommendation System (F11)
  - Real-time Chat (F12)



## **3. Requirement Changes / Clarifications**

- Admin-facing requirements were formalized this week:
  - Review status labels (Pending / Approved / Published — FR-08)
  - Admin moderation capability (FR-09)

- Privacy was clarified as a requirement (FR-15):
  - HallPass will collect only essential information.
  - Reviews will be displayed using a display name or initials instead of the user's full identity.



## **4. Problems Encountered**

- **Technical problem:** Organizing and linking the user stories, system requirements, and diagrams so they remained consistent throughout the documentation.
- **Team coordination problem:** Coordinating document updates across team members and ensuring everyone's contributions aligned before merging.
- **Evidence/requirement problem:** Some user needs overlapped, requiring revisions to the user persona, requirements, and user stories before the final versions were agreed upon.

## Decisions Made Today

### 1. Business Model Decision
The team confirmed that HallPass will remain a student-driven campus survival guide focused on helping first-year, international, and exchange students access trustworthy dormitory reviews, cafeteria reviews, and campus survival information. Advanced services such as AI recommendations, booking, and payment systems remain outside the MVP scope.

### 2. Technical Architecture Decision
The final prototype will be implemented as a front-end web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project will use a static prototype structure with sample data and a consistent navigation flow across all pages.

### 3. Data Structure Decision
The prototype data structure was finalized to include the following core entities:

- User
- Dormitory Review
- Cafeteria Review
- Campus Survival Guide
- Dashboard Summary

These entities are sufficient to support the current MVP without requiring a production database.

### 4. Diagram Decision
The team finalized the navigation flow and confirmed that every implemented prototype page corresponds directly to the documented user stories, system requirements, and MVP features. Documentation diagrams and mappings were updated to reflect the actual prototype instead of the previous template.

---

## Problems or Risks Found

- Several documentation files still contained outdated template page names and prototype paths that required synchronization.
- Maintaining consistency between requirements, user stories, feature mappings, and prototype pages required multiple rounds of review.
- Since the current prototype is front-end only, all review data and dashboard information remain simulated rather than connected to a real database.
- Time management was important because both prototype refinement and documentation updates had to be completed together.

---

## Next Actions Before Lab 07

- Conduct final testing of all prototype navigation and page links.
- Verify responsive layouts on different screen sizes.
- Review and polish the visual design for consistency across all pages.
- Capture final prototype screenshots for documentation.
- Review the GitHub repository to ensure all files are complete, synchronized, and ready for submission.
- Fix any remaining UI or documentation inconsistencies identified during testing.

## Decisions Made Today

### 1. MVP Experiment Type

The team selected a combination of **Simple Web Prototype**, **Clickable Prototype**, and **Form-Based Simulation** to evaluate HallPass. The prototype allows users to browse dormitory and cafeteria reviews, search information, view review details, register or log in, submit reviews, and explore the Campus Survival Guide.

### 2. Experiment Objective

The objective of the MVP experiment is to determine whether first-year, international, and exchange students can successfully complete the main HallPass tasks without assistance while validating that the prototype solves the campus information problems identified in previous labs.

### 3. Critical Assumptions

The team identified and ranked assumptions related to:

- User problems
- Value proposition
- Usability
- Technical feasibility
- Business logic

Each assumption was linked to system requirements, user stories, and planned testing activities.

### 4. Success Metrics

The team defined measurable success criteria including:

- Homepage understanding rate
- Dormitory review browsing success
- Search and filter success
- Review detail understanding
- Review submission completion
- Overall usability rating
- Feature usefulness rating

These metrics will determine whether the prototype is ready for further implementation.

### 5. Experiment Preparation

Five representative testers were selected:

- First-year Undergraduate Student
- International Student
- Exchange Student
- Senior Undergraduate Student
- Administrator (Content Moderator)

The team prepared a structured experiment script and neutral feedback form to collect both quantitative ratings and qualitative comments.

---

## Problems or Risks Found

- Authentication and review storage are currently simulated using Local Storage instead of a production database.
- Review moderation is demonstrated through the prototype but does not include real backend approval functionality.
- Additional usability testing is required to validate navigation, search functionality, and review submission before implementation.
- Different user backgrounds may influence feedback, requiring careful interpretation of experiment results.

---

## Decisions Made Today

### 1. Customer Validation

The team conducted customer validation using the HallPass MVP prototype with representative users. Validation focused on whether users could successfully browse dormitory and cafeteria reviews, access the Campus Survival Guide, log in, and submit reviews. User feedback and task performance were collected as evidence for evaluating the prototype.

### 2. Validation Analytics

The validation data was organized into Excel and CSV datasets and analyzed using a Power BI dashboard. Key metrics included task success rate, average ease-of-use score, average usefulness score, average interest level, and the most common confusion points. These analytics helped the team identify the strengths and weaknesses of the MVP.

### 3. MVP Decision

Based on the customer validation results, the team decided to **continue with minor revisions**. The prototype achieved the predefined success metrics and demonstrated that HallPass effectively addresses student needs. However, usability improvements are required for the login and signup workflow, navigation, search functionality, and review presentation.

### 4. Prototype Improvements

The validation results identified the following improvements for the next prototype iteration:

- Simplify the login and signup workflow.
- Improve navigation labels and menu visibility.
- Enhance the search and filter interface.
- Improve the visibility of ratings and review summaries.
- Expand dormitory, cafeteria, and campus guide content.

---

## Problems or Risks Found

- Login and signup navigation remained the most common confusion point during validation.
- Some users had difficulty locating search and filter controls.
- The current prototype stores data using Local Storage rather than a backend database.
- Additional review content and campus information will improve the usefulness of the system.

---

## Decisions Made Today

### 1. Data Inventory and Privacy Review

The team reviewed all data collected by the HallPass prototype and identified which fields were necessary for the MVP. Personal information such as student name, student ID, and email address was limited to authentication purposes, while unnecessary sensitive data was excluded from the prototype.

### 2. Legal, Ethical, and Consent Review

The project was reviewed to ensure that it does not make misleading claims, unfairly exclude users, or collect unnecessary personal information. A privacy and data protection document, legal and ethical checklist, and user consent statement were prepared to support responsible system development.

### 3. IP and Third-Party Asset Review

All third-party resources used in the project, including Google Fonts, Unsplash images, GitHub, Power BI, browser Local Storage, and ChatGPT, were documented together with their sources, licenses, and usage. The team also created a Privacy and Security Review workflow diagram to summarize the responsible design review process.

### 4. Security Risk Assessment

The team reviewed authentication, form validation, Local Storage usage, review submission, and administrator access. Security risks were documented together with mitigation strategies in the security risk register. The current MVP uses sample data and Local Storage only, reducing the risk of exposing real user information during testing.

---

## Problems or Risks Found

- Authentication currently relies on Local Storage instead of a secure backend database.
- User passwords are not encrypted because the prototype is frontend-only.
- Administrator authentication is simulated and requires backend implementation in future versions.
- Review content moderation is manually simulated and should be strengthened in future development.
- Additional security measures will be required before deploying the system in a production environment.

| **Htet Htet Myint Zaw – Member 1** | Developed the HallPass frontend and core screens, including the homepage, review submission form, review lists, review details, page navigation, and responsive layout structure.                                                                                          | GitHub Issue #55, core HTML pages in `prototype/`, frontend commits, and interface screenshots                                                                                                |
| **Khaing Zin Thet – Member 2**     | Implemented JavaScript functionality, sample data, form validation, search and rating filters, review details, moderation actions, submission statuses, localStorage persistence, and screenshot evidence.                                                                 | GitHub Issue #56, files in `prototype/js/`, functionality commits, and files in `screenshots/`                                                                                                |
| **Yousel Zangmo – Member 3**       | Updated Sprint 1 documentation and repository structure, created and maintained the main stylesheet, updated the prototype link, implementation plan, feature implementation status, weekly logbook, and README, and checked that the required files matched Prototype 15. | GitHub Issue #57, `prototype/css/style.css`, `prototype/prototype-link.md`, `docs/implementation-plan.md`, `docs/feature-implementation-status.md`, `docs/weekly-logbook.md`, and `README.md` |

## Screenshots Added

The following screenshots will be included as evidence of the implemented Prototype 15 features:

* `/screenshots/homepage.png`
* `/screenshots/login-signup.png`
* `/screenshots/dormitory-list.png`
* `/screenshots/cafeteria-list.png`
* `/screenshots/search-filter.png`
* `/screenshots/review-detail.png`
* `/screenshots/input-form.png`
* `/screenshots/privacy-consent.png`
* `/screenshots/student-dashboard.png`
* `/screenshots/status-tracking.png`
* `/screenshots/admin-view.png`
* `/screenshots/moderation-queue.png`
* `/screenshots/report-management.png`
* `/screenshots/user-management.png`
* `/screenshots/audit-log.png`
* `/screenshots/responsive-mobile-view.png`


## Problems Faced

* The new Prototype 15 structure and filenames were different from the earlier prototype documentation.
* Some requirement IDs in the previous implementation plan did not match the updated system requirements.
* Several features, such as reports and user management, were visible in the administrator dashboard but were only partially simulated.
* Browser localStorage was used instead of a real backend, so data was limited to the same browser and device.
* Authentication and role checking were simulated through frontend JavaScript and were not secure.
* Some prototype pages used different CSS and JavaScript files, which made consistency and maintenance more difficult.
* The team needed to ensure that navigation links worked correctly across all Prototype 15 pages.
* Responsive layouts required additional testing to prevent overlapping content on smaller screens.
* Existing screenshots could become outdated after changes to the prototype.
* Team contributions needed to be clearly connected to GitHub issues, commits, files, and screenshots.

To address these problems, the team reviewed the actual Prototype 15 files, corrected the documentation, used shared styling and JavaScript where possible, tested the main workflows, and clearly marked simulated and partially completed features.

## Plan for Next Lab

In the next lab, the team plans to:

* Conduct usability and functional testing of Prototype 15
* Test all navigation links and user workflows
* Test the prototype on desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes
* Check form validation and privacy-consent behaviour
* Verify review submission and status tracking
* Test administrator approval and rejection actions
* Review reports, user-management examples, and audit-log records
* Fix any interface, JavaScript, or responsive-design problems
* Capture updated screenshots of all required features
* Update GitHub issues with contribution evidence
* Confirm that all files are placed in the correct repository folders
* Complete final quality assurance before submission
* Prepare the project for the next MVP testing and validation stage

## Main Decisions

- Use the headline **“Your shortcut to campus life.”**
- Lead with the needs of first-year, international, and exchange students.
- Use **Try the HallPass Demo** as the primary CTA.
- Promote only features represented in the current prototype.
- Label validation results with their context and avoid presenting them as
  current market traction.
- Identify the page and prototype as classroom demonstrations using
  fictional/sample data and browser-local storage.

## Metrics Plan

The group will measure landing-page views, channel visits, primary CTA clicks,
CTA click rate, demo attempts, feature exploration, feedback responses,
usefulness, feedback conversion, and assigned-task completion. Channel results
will be recorded in `data/acquisition-metrics-template.csv`.

## Problems Encountered

- Browser `localStorage` counters do not provide reliable multi-user analytics.
- The prototype is frontend-only, so messages must not imply production
  security, live accounts, or cloud data.
- Contribution links cannot be finalized until each member commits their work.

## Next Action Before Lab 13

- Upload the completed Lab 12 files to the shared repository.
- Have each member commit their assigned contribution.
- Replace contribution placeholders with actual commit/issue/PR links.
- Publish or share the landing-page link.
- Run the first early-user channel test and replace zero values in the metrics
  CSV with observed counts.
- Review feedback and revise the landing-page message or prototype workflow.

## Requirement Change Record

### Change Summary

During Lab 14, the team added or formally included the following final prototype requirements:

| Requirement ID | Requirement change | Final implementation |
|---|---|---|
| FR-23 | Add Saved Places for student-specific favourites | `prototype/js/data.js`, `prototype/index.html`, `prototype/student-dashboard.html` |
| FR-24 | Add comparison of two or three saved places from the same category, with a quick recommendation | `prototype/js/student-dashboard.js`, `prototype/student-dashboard.html` |
| FR-25 | Add Recently Viewed places | `prototype/js/data.js`, Student Dashboard |
| FR-26 | Add helpful voting and verification labels | `prototype/js/data.js`, `prototype/review-details.html` |
| FR-27 | Add external Google Maps place links | `prototype/review-details.html` |
| NFR-05 | Extend the performance requirement to include WebP image optimization | `prototype/images/hero/`, `prototype/images/reviews/` |

### Reason for the Changes

The changes were made after the Lab 13 user-testing analysis and Lab 14 final improvement review. Students needed clearer ways to save and compare choices, return to previously viewed places, identify useful or verified content, and locate places through a familiar map service. WebP optimization was included to reduce the size of the main visual assets. These additions improve decision support and usability without changing HallPass from a frontend-only classroom prototype.

## Problems Found Before Submission

- The prototype uses browser `localStorage`, so data does not synchronize across browsers or devices.
- Authentication, authorization, and administrator controls are simulated and are not suitable for production use.
- The final prototype must be tested in the presentation browser before delivery, especially the student/admin workflow, links, responsive layout, and screenshot paths.
- The GitHub Pages URL and any external Google Maps links must be checked before presenting.

## Action Before Final Presentation

- Run one final student and administrator end-to-end walkthrough.
- Open and verify the prototype link, final demo flow, screenshots, README links, and pitch materials.
- Confirm all Lab 14 checklist items are marked after the final verification.
- Present HallPass as a classroom frontend prototype with fictional data, simulated authentication, and browser-local storage.
