# Wireframe Specification

## Design Direction

HallPass should feel like a student-friendly campus guide rather than a formal university system. The interface uses warm neutral backgrounds, dark navy text, soft gold highlights, rounded cards, clear buttons, and simple navigation. All screens should look consistent across the prototype.
